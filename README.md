# Proof on why the 'Rockstar' Incident is Fake

The code name 'Rockstar' incident occurred on November 8, 2023, around 11:20 AM in the 9 - Flexible classroom on the group 1 row near the wall.

## Chapter 1: The Beginning

I was inside our classroom talking with a classmate. Then, suddenly, the "Rockstar" started shaking in her seat and scrambling down to the ground. Everyone was panicking, and I could hear her screaming. After witnessing all this, I thought it was a medical emergency, so I ran straight to the clinic for help. After the nurse arrived, she said it wasn't medical-related. Since we didn't have contact with her parents, our advisor told Jomariz and me to go to her house (since we knew where she lived) and tell her parents to come pick her up. After we arrived, her siblings looked a bit worried when we mentioned that our "Rockstar" was having an emergency. Then, suddenly, her youngest sibling asked us if we were her classmates. When we said yes, he started smiling and giggling. I was alarmed by his reaction, as I couldn't understand why anyone would laugh in an emergency, especially a family member. Finally, her father came out, and we told him what happened. We then all went back to school together.

### Point 1: The "Rockstar's" Reputation
Our "Rockstar" has a reputation for lying, acting, and being dramatic. Jomariz also mentioned that she's very "flexible" and can move parts of her body in ways that most people can't. All of this contributes to how she can play the act of being possessed.

### Point 2: Her Family's Reaction
When we arrived at her house, her brother was smiling and giggling when we told them that an emergency had occurred at our school involving their "Rockstar." Her father also seemingly showed a neutral reaction when his daughter was literally lying on the floor as if she were dead.

### Point 3: The "Rockstar's" Reactions
At first, she started screaming and moving aggressively. Whenever she was about to scream, she would always take a few extra breaths, as if she was acting it out. Also, if she could scream, why didn't she call for help or at least scream for someone's name? Additionally, when Jomariz and I arrived, she stopped screaming all of a sudden, as if she got tired from it. Also, I heard that she was swearing at our advisor while she was praying for her, which is a huge coincidence, as if she could hear our advisor praying. (Can anyone confirm that Ma'am Bev was loud enough for Rockstar to hear her pray??)

## Chapter 2: The Interview

When Jomariz and I interviewed the "Rockstar," I first asked her what she experienced during the incident. From what I remember, she said that at first, she saw a treehouse.

### Point 1: Treehouse
When I investigated the scene where the incident took place, I realized that the treehouse can only be viewed from a certain angle (only from where I was sitting and the people in front of me). When the incident happened, the "Rockstar" was sitting down near the back of the seats, and there was no window on her side, only walls. Her eyes were also closed when the incident happened. Therefore, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO way she could have seen the treehouse.

The "Rockstar" said she saw a big black man who tried to take her away. I asked her if the man was inside or outside the house, and she said he was in the treehouse at first. However, I pointed out that she can't even see the treehouse from her seat, so how could she have seen the man inside it? She then agreed that the man must have teleported inside the house. I also asked her if her spirit or soul was taken away, and she said yes, but in the group chat, she said that her brain was taken away. This inconsistency makes me think that she is lying.

### Point 2: Agreeing with Me Too Much
The fact that the "Rockstar" kept agreeing to my unsure questions is also proof that she was running out of ideas to hide her scheme. When she arrived at school, she was quiet and distant from others. This is also proof that she was thinking about what she had done or thinking of some other excuse that could get her away from it.

### Point 3: Shifting and Changing the Story
In the group chat, she said that her "brain" was taken away.

However, when Jomariz and I interviewed her and asked if her spirit was taken away, she said yes. This is highly suspicious, as she completely ignored Jomariz's question about her brain and shifted the conversation to other topics like asking if the people outside dancing are practicing for the cheerleading thing.

After she said those things, I asked her what the "Big Black Man" wanted or what she did during the incident or when she was experiencing all of this. She said that she asked the "Big Black Man" why he took her away and what he wanted from her. Then, she started swearing words like "Yawa ka" and "Demonyo ka." She started saying these words when our advisor, Ma'am Bev, started praying for her. This is a huge coincidence, and I think we can all agree that it was a terrible thing for the "Rockstar" to do to our advisor. I then asked her if she knew that this building was "haunted" or if she knew that this place had "incidents" like hers, and she said yes.

### Point 4: She Planned This All Along

The "Rockstar" immediately agreed with me when I asked if the building was haunted. I asked this question because I remembered she had said this in the group chat. I then asked her how many people she knew who had gone through this experience, and she said three. However, I have never heard of possessions occurring in our building, and I was studying in the same building last year while the "Rockstar" was studying in a whole different building. So, how does she know about these possessions and I don't? She seemed shocked when I told her that I didn't know about them, as if she is trying to emphasize that she knows more about the building than I do. I also asked her if she knew about the possessions before they happened, and she said yes. Additionally, the "Rockstar" was absent on Monday and Tuesday before the incident happened on Wednesday. Since she knew about the possessions ahead of time, it makes sense that she planned the whole thing.

## Chapter 3: Why Did She Do It?

### Reason 1: Attention
In Chapter 1, Point 1, she does have a reputation for lying and crying to get ATTENTION or to get away with her problems. So one of the few reasons I can think of why she would do something is because she wants ATTENTION.

### Reason 2: She Likes Being... Touched..?
We all know why she is called a 'Rockstar,' and I won't go through why but just know the fact that during the incident, there were lots of boys touching her body, and she kept uh.. Moving.. So maybe she's just trying to fulfill her disgusting fantasies?

### Reason 3: She's Fricken Insane and Needs Psychological Help
I don't need to go through this one as much, as the title pretty much explains it.

## Final Thoughts
I'm pretty sure we have enough proof to stop investigating, but I think I have a few more questions to ask, though it's a bit risky. I still have more stuff to cover, but I will work on it soon. But we'll see in the future on what will happen next.
